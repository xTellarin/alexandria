# Newlib
Alexandria is a self-hosted reading list in vanilla HTML, CSS, Javascrit and PHP. It uses mySQL as a way of storing your reading list data, but also creates an HTML backup for portability and archiving.

I've been looking for ways to store my collection of comics but I found nothing that worked for me and that could be as seamless as this. So out of frustration for obfuscated content (hello Wordpress) and lazyness (opening another app is hard work) I created Newlib.

## Capabilities
Newlib is still a work in progress, but can do the following:
- **Add new records.** Using a dedicated page, you can add a new record with the Title, Last Read Chapter, Translator and Tags as well as its link, embedded in the title.
- **Edit existing records.** If you'd like to update the tags, rating or anything else.
- **Interactive search:** Search by tag or translator (team).
- **Seamless chapter editing.** Caught up to the latest chapter? Simply enter the new chapter number and click update next to the record you want to update.
- **Sort by Team and Rating.** Perfect if you'd like to read your favorites record first or a team's translations in one go.

## Work in progress
- **Adding title search.** Sometimes you just know what to read.
